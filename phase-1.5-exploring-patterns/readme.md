## 🎯 Objective

Build absolute control over:

- Nested loop mechanics
- Space and star alignment
- Symmetry logic
- Index mathematics
- Visual pattern construction

This phase is not about decoration.  
It is about structural precision.

## 🧠 Engineering Focus

In this phase, I trained myself to:

- Think in rows and columns
- Visualize output before coding
- Derive star formulas logically
- Balance space and star placement
- Build patterns without trial-and-error guessing

## 📂 Patterns Conquered

| # | Pattern | Core Concept |
|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Right-angled Triangle | Incremental growth logic |
| 2 | Pyramid | Space-star balance |
| 3 | Diamond | Upper + lower symmetry |
| 4 | Inverted Triangle | Reverse loop control |
| 5 | Number Half Pyramid | Numeric progression |
| 6 | Floyd’s Triangle | Continuous counting logic |
| 7 | 0-1 Triangle | Conditional printing inside loops |
| 8 | Hollow Pyramid | Border condition control |
| 9 | Butterfly Pattern | Dual-side symmetry |
| 10 | Sandglass Pattern | Shrinking + expanding structure |

⚔️ This is where loops stop being syntax  
and start becoming structure.
