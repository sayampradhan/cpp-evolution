/*
BUILDING A GUESSING GAME

- We take the input from the user for range of the randomly generated number.
- We let the machine generate a random number as per the user's preference.
- We let the user input a number to guess it.
    - If the number matches the random number,
        - we will say great. you guessed it right.
    - If the number is less than the random number,
        - we will say, the number is little greater.
    - If the number is greater than the random number,
        - we will say, the number is little lesser.
