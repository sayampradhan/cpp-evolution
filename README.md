# 🧠 Engineering Laws

1. Fundamentals are non-negotiable  
2. No blind copy-paste  
3. Rewrite from memory  
4. Analyze time & space  
5. Refactor aggressively  
6. Clean commits only  
7. Think like a systems engineer  

## 🧭 Why This Exists

Most people consume tutorials.  
Few build depth.

This repository exists to:
- Build unshakable fundamentals
- Train algorithmic thinking
- Develop systems intuition
- Track visible progress
- Stay accountable publicly

## 🚀 End State

By this tracker reaches 100%, I will be able to:

- Design efficient data structures from scratch
- Understand memory layout & performance trade-offs
- Write production-grade C++
- Build multi-threaded systems
- Think in algorithms naturally

⚔️ This repository is not about solving problems.  

It is about building a mind capable of solving anything.
